To Do:

1. Try to figure out how to put css that applies to all pages in one file (Done for Nav and Footer and other things like back-ground positioning)

2. Figure out how the heck to organize files in folders without GitHub deciding it will refuse to launch the page correctly

DONE:

Add images to "Our Work" page

Fix flex-boxes having different margins on values

Make a values page (add the stuff from contact.html)

Fix footer styles once page content is added (unnecessary top margen, not relative, etc.)

Add media queries to every page

Fix navbar bug when screen is small with media query

Fix navbar changing a bit on Our Work (FINALLY DONE!!!)

Add favicon !!

Make sensible image names

Background images can't stretch at small and tall resolutions.

Make an actual contact page... (Added form)

Deal with new break points. Mostly with navbar fixes (does weird stuff on values and services). Also fix footer being cut-off...

Add filler images to About Us page for each person
